## Technical Stack

### Core Technologies
- **Language**: Python 3.9+
- **Agent Framework**: LangGraph
- **Database**: PostgreSQL
- **NLP Libraries**: spaCy, NLTK, transformers
- **API Framework**: FastAPI (for external interfaces)

### Key Dependencies
- `langgraph` - Agent orchestration
- `langchain` - LLM integration
- `psycopg2` - PostgreSQL adapter
- `pydantic` - Data validation
- `pytest` - Testing framework

## Success Metrics

### Technical KPIs
- **Data Processing Speed**: Support tickets processed per minute
- **Accuracy**: Empathy map quality scores
- **Coverage**: Percentage of tickets successfully analyzed
- **Performance**: Response time for queries and analysis

### Business KPIs
- **Time-to-Synthesis**: Speed from data ingestion to final empathy map
- **Duplicate Insight Rate**: Measure of unique vs. redundant insights
- **User Satisfaction**: Quality ratings from human reviewers
- **Compliance**: PII redaction accuracy and consent validation success

## Risk Mitigation

### Technical Risks
- **Data Quality**: Implement robust validation and cleaning
- **Scalability**: Design for horizontal scaling from the start
- **Performance**: Monitor and optimize critical paths
- **Integration Complexity**: Start with mocked integrations

### Compliance Risks
- **PII Exposure**: Implement multiple layers of protection
- **Consent Violations**: Strict validation and audit trails
- **Bias**: Diverse sampling and human oversight
- **Data Retention**: Clear policies and automated cleanup

## Next Steps

1. **Immediate**: Set up project structure and basic environment
2. **Week 1**: Focus on data ingestion and basic RAG implementation
3. **Week 2**: Implement PII redaction and basic analysis
4. **Ongoing**: Regular reviews and adjustments based on progress

## Notes
- All external tool integrations will be mocked initially
- Focus on core functionality before adding advanced features
- Regular testing and validation throughout development
- Document all decisions and architectural choices
